                    Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,<br>
                    That having such a scope to show her pride,<br>
                    The argument all bare is of more worth <br>
                    Than when it hath my added praise beside! <br><br>

                    O, blame me not, if I no more can write! <br>
                    Look in your glass, and there appears a face <br>
                    That over-goes my blunt invention quite, <br>
                    Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace. <br><br>

                    Were it not sinful then, striving to mend, <br>
                    To mar the subject that before was well? <br>
                    For to no other pass my verses tend <br>
                    Than of your graces and your gifts to tell; <br><br>

                    And more, much more, than in my verse can sit <br>
                    Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

                    My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; <br>
                    Coral is far more red than her lips' red; <br>
                    If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; <br>
                    If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. <br><br>

                    I have seen roses damask'd, red and white, <br>
                    But no such roses see I in her cheeks; <br>
                    And in some perfumes is there more delight <br>
                    Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. <br><br>

                    I love to hear her speak, yet well I know <br>
                    That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>
                    I grant I never saw a goddess go; <br>
                    My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: <br><br>

                    And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare <br>
                    As any she belied with false compare.
